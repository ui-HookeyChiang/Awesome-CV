    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item Dedicated to UNAS, including NPI deliveries, test plans, and
          feature developements on Alpine AL524.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Researched and developed cohesive user-friendly NAS solutions
            on Debian, involving network discovery, Samba, snapshots, data
            backup, data integrity, system-data migration; shared product
            visions, specifications, documents, code snippets in Confluence with
            cross-functional teams.
          \item Ported Linux from 4.19 to 5.10, resolving code incompatibilities
            and regressions rooted in PCI, RAID, PHY, AHCI, by cautiously
            backtracking Linux and BSP. Holistically verified system stability
            and performance with stress-ng, fio, xfstest, packetdriller, and
            Phoronix Test Suite. Additionally, increased write performance by
            40\% by appling the mq-deadline scheduler and Btrfs sync disk-io.
          \item Achieved 800MB/s Samba bandwidth over 10GbE by tuning both the
            server and client.
          \item Reduced cross-device copies, quota accounting and data leakage
            with the FS layout redesign.
          \item Worked around the issue of hours-long unresponsiveness caused
            by Btrfs subvolume deletions.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Brought system stability and performance improvements to all
          UniFi-OS products.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Lowered the overhead of a Python CLI by 65\% usage in CPU and
            50\% in memory, leading to a 30\% reduction in system load.
            Introduced a gRPC state exporter for lightweight streaming
            notifications.
          \item Fixed an OOM bug due to misbehaving socket forward allocation on
            a 64kB page-sized system.
        \end{itemize}
      \end{cvitems}

  \cventry
    {Software Engineer} % Job title
    {QNAP Systems Inc.} % Organization
    {Taiwan} % Location
    {Jan. 2018 - Feb. 2022} % Date(s)
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item Took full part in Hybridmount, a FS as cloud storage gateway,
          deployed on 190K QNAP devices as of 2021, supporting video streaming
          and accessible via common protocols, e.g., SMB, NFS, and FTP.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Designed the database schema, CLI, IPC protocol, and loopback-fs
            cache management.
          \item Maintained software quality by composing unit, integration, and
            stress tests, incorporating pjdfstest and filebench, and building
            automated CI pipelines using Jenkins and Docker. Handled fewer than
            20 support tickets since the first official release.
          \item Reduced duration of compiling codes from 30 minutes to fewer
            than 10 minutes.
          \item Reduced the time to create 50 million files from 60 days
            on SSDs to less than 7 days on HDDs.
          \item Continuously improved runtime performance, achieving a 50\%
            increase in sequential write speed, 10\% random read, 300\% metadata
            operations through various optimizations, including filename
            hashing, file read-ahead, multi-threading, fine-grained locking, VFS
            caching, database index.
          \item Successfully utilized VFS dcache by carefully handling unicode
            normalization and case sensitivity.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Implemented features in deduplication filesystem, write-back cache
          and chunk defragmentation. Refactored read/write operations, reducing
          the related codebase by 50\% and additionally resolving abnormal data
          display at chunk edges.
        \item Analyzed and created POC of a POSIX-compliant cloud-tiering file
          system with FUSE, IPFS in golang.
