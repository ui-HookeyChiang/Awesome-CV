    {UniFi-OS Storage Software Engineer} % Job title
    {Ubiquiti Inc.} % Organization
    {Taiwan/Remote} % Location
    {Mar. 2022 - Present} % Date(s)
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Delievered UNAS NPIs, including bringups, factory test
          plans, and service maintenance on Debian.}
        \item Upgraded Linux from 4.19 to 5.10, handling incompatibilities with back-tracking mainline commits.
        \item Provided technical guidance, implementing cohesive user-friendly NAS solutions involving Samba, snapshots, data backup, data integrity, system-data migration, secure network discovery; shared these specifications, documents, reproducible code snippets in Confluence with cross-teams.
        \item Redesigned the fs layout to reduce needless writes by 50\% and address leakage of internal data.
        \item Tuned btrfs configs on atime, space\_cache, qgroup usage to achieve
        better 8\% read and 5\% write.
        \item Quantified and worked-around hours-long subvolume deletions causing btrfs unresponsive.
        \item Brought system stability and performance improvements to all products with UniFi-OS.
        \item Reduced overheads of a python cli by 65\% of CPU, 50\% of memory, then
        resulting in 15\%-to-50\% less-load-average system. Then introduced a gRPC state exporter for subscription and streaming.
        \item Resolved an OOM due to socket buffers on a 64kB page-sized system,
        reducing 93\% over-allocation.
        \item Assured software quality with tools such as golang test framework, xfstest, and packetdriller.

    {Software Engineer} % Job title
    {QNAP Systems Inc.} % Organization
    {Taiwan} % Location
    {Jan. 2018 - Feb. 2022} % Date(s)
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Took full part in Hybridmount, a FS as cloud storage
          gateway, deployed on 190K QNAP devices as of 2021, supporting video
          streaming and accessible via common protocols, e.g., SMB, NFS, and FTP.}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item {Designed the database schema, CLI, IPC protocol, and loopback-fs cache
            management.}
          \item {Maintained software quality by composing unit, integration, and
              stress tests, incorporating public FS test suites (pjdfstest) and
            benchmarks (filebench), and building automated CI pipelines using
            Jenkins and Docker. Handled fewer than 20 support tickets since the
            first official release.}
          \item {Reduced duration of compiling codes from 30 minutes to fewer
            than 10 minutes.}
          \item {Reduced the time to create 50 million files from 60 days
            on SSDs to less than 7 days on HDDs.}
          \item {Continuously improved runtime performance, achieving a 50\%
            increase in sequential write speed, 10\% random read, 300\% metadata
            operations through various optimizations, including filename
            hashing, file read-ahead, multi-threading, fine-grained locking, VFS
            caching, database index.}
          \item {Successfully utilized VFS dcache by carefully handling unicode
            normalization and case sensitivity.}
        \end{itemize}
        \item {Implemented features in deduplication filesystem, write-back
            cache and chunk defragmentation. Refactored read/write operations,
            reducing the related codebase by 50\% and additionally resolving
          abnormal data display at chunk edges.}
        \item {Analyzed and created POC of a POSIX-compliant cloud-tiering file
          system with FUSE, IPFS in golang.}
